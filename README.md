CMB distortion calculation for a WIMP annihilation

For the use of the codes a library named 'data' should be created, in which files from
Complete fluxes at production, including EW corrections as computed in 1009.0224
at http://www.marcocirelli.net/PPPC4DMID.html 
should be extracted.

The Create_PPPC_pie_plots.py reproduces the pie plots as in Figure 4 at http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.4515
